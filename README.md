# tbdflow VS Code extension

Simple VS Code extension for [tbdflow](https://github.com/cladam/tbdflow). Main features added by this extension are:
- `tbdflow commit` Activity Bar
- Commands:
    - `tbdflow: New Branch`
    - `tbdflow: Complete Branch`
    - `tbdflow: Sync`
    - `tbdflow: Generate Changelog`
    - `tbdflow: Status`
    - `tbdflow: Current Branch`
    - `tbdflow: Check Stale Branches`

## Gitâ€‘project awareness

The extension can hide its commands and the commit view unless the current workspace is a Git repository.

- Setting: `tbdflow.gitProjectAwareness.enabled` (default: `true`)
- When disabled, all commands and the view are always visible.
- While debugging the extension (Run Extension / F5), this awareness is automatically disabled so you can always see the commands.
