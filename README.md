# tbdflow Code plugin

Simple VS Code extension that adds a "tbdflow" button to the Activity Bar (left side). Clicking it opens a panel showing "Hello tbdflow".

## Install / Run from Source

- Prerequisite: Install Visual Studio Code.
- Open this folder in VS Code.
- Run the extension:
  - Press `F5` (or go to `Run and Debug` and start "Run Extension").
  - A new "Extension Development Host" window opens.
- In the new window, click the `tbdflow` icon in the Activity Bar. You should see a panel with "Hello tbdflow".

## Optional: Package as VSIX

If you want a distributable `.vsix`:

- Install `vsce` (`npm i -g @vscode/vsce`).
- Run `vsce package` in this folder to generate a `.vsix`.
- In VS Code, use `Extensions` panel menu â†’ `Install from VSIX...` and select the generated file.
